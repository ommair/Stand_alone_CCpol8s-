Given code is written for the paper 

How well can polarization models of pairwise nonadditive forces describe liquid water?

Current version of the code is written by Ommair Ishaque, August 8, 2023 

It reads geometry file dimers_geo_xyz.dat which contains 3216 dimer configurations.
Position of all sites are required as input, see dimers_geo_xyz.dat

There are four options given for NB-induction model to run this code. You need to specify in the CONTROL file which option is required.

Below is the example CONTROL file for "damped_ind" with "physical_dipole" model.
 
ccpol8s_omo         # potential name (ccpol8s_omo)
user_config         # inintial configuration (fcc_config or user_config)
damped_ind          # damped_ind or undamped_ind
physical_dipole     # physical_dipole or mathematical_dipole

if you want to use "damped_ind" with mathemaitcal dipole then change the last line to "mathematical_dipole"

similarly for other possibilities.

In the OUTPUT file it prints vdw, Coulomb, NB-induction and CCpol8s (sum of latter three) in kcal/mol.

Finally use the make file to compile the code

make
